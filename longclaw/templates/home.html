                    <h3>Technique 1: "Total Recall"</h3>
                    <p>Try to remember some similar problems that you had to solve. Quite many problems do not have a brand new idea. So probably, you can use your experience of solving a similar problem to solve this one.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Technique 2: "From Specific to General"</h3>
                    <p>Let's say that you've found the solution for the problem (hurray!). Let's consider some particular case of a problem. Of course, you can apply the algorithm/solution to it. That's why, in order to solve a general problem, you need to solve all of its specific cases. Try solving some (or multiple) specific cases and then try and generalize them to the solution of the main problem. Such specific cases can be regarded as the simplifications of the problem, i.e. we can reason by the following principle: "if I don't know how to solve a complex problem, I think I'll simplify it and find the solutions of the simplified version".&#13;&#10;
                        <br>
                        <br> The popular examples of simplifications (specific cases):
                        <div class="ui bulleted list">
                            <div class="item">you get a problem for a tree. Consider its variant where the tree degenerates into a path; </div>
                            <div class="item">the problem has weights? Consider a variant where all the weights are equal either to one or to an arbitrary number, or there are only two distinct weights (and so on).</div>
                            Note that the solution of a specific case almost always isn't easier than the solution of a general one, so you need to try and find a solution that would be as easy and effective as possible.
                        </div>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Technique 3: "To solve a problem, you should think like a problem"</h3>
                    <p>I'm serious, put yourself in the shoes of the character of the problem, imagine that it's your job to handle the input sets. Think about how you'd act in this case. Try to process some small samples on your own. If the problem is about a game, play it. Sometimes I try to visualize a process or a model for better understanding. It's a little like how movies show the way scientists think. Try to think in images, imagine the solution, see it unfolding.</p>
                    <h3>Technique 4: "Pick a Method"</h3>
                    <p>Try coming through popular algorithms or methods that can apply to the problem in any way. It is useful to see the problem limits. Having picked a method, try thinking on the solution assuming that the problem is solved using this method. Your reasonings should be somewhat like this: "Let's assume that the problem is solved by divide and conquer. Then let us solve this problem recursively for the left and right half. Now all that's left is to find a way to unite these solutions. I wonder how we can do that..."</p>
                    <h3>Technique 5: "Google"</h3>
                    <p>This technique can only be used if the round/contest rules allow it. If the problem is about sequences, then you can look for solutions (see technique 7) on the The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences® (OEIS®) Wiki. It helps to understand the formal model of the problem and google the correct mathematical terms.</p>
